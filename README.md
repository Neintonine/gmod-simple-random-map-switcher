2. If your gamemode is supported, you could stop right here. But if you want, you can checkout the [configuration](https://github.com/Neintonine/gmod-simple-random-map-switcher/wiki/Configurations), if you want to change anything.
3. If your gamemode is not supported, please checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/Neintonine/gmod-simple-random-map-switcher/wiki/Integrations#adding-new-integrations) to see how you could make it work.

## Motivation
I developed this add-on, because I didn't seem to find a good simple add-on for randomly switching to TTT maps for my server.
But I found a neat little add-on, that allows for mapvotes [rafs-mapvote](https://github.com/ksprugevics/rafs-mapvote/tree/main), what ultimately let me to developing my own script for randomly choosing a map.
After testing it out on my server, I decided to create an add-on out of it, to both share it and to improve it.
